How to add a driver
===================

A driver has the same format as a normal command.
But the first thing a driver does is hooking into the driver-table
of the system.
search for a unused table-position :
	ldy # 15
     a: lda $C2A0,y
	beq found
	dey
	bpl a
	->error
 found: lda # DriverChar (in ascii)
	sta $C2A0,y
	lda # DriverPage
	sta $C2B0,y
 (maybe i'll make a systemcall for this in a later LUnix version)

The signal-pointer then have a special meaning
 signal 1 :  PLoad-Pointer
 signal 15:  called by the system when a process is killed
	     (the driver has to close files /unlock used semaphores)
 (the other singals aren't defined yet. They may be used in a later
  version for things like 'open file' 'close file' 'get' 'print' ...usw)

Next thing the driver does is declaring his code-memory to driver-used-
memory (replace PID by #38 in the memory-pageowner table $C300)
and commit suicide.
(the driver-code will stay in memory ! and can be executed by all other
processes using the singal-pointer..)

(.... to be continued)
