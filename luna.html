<BODY>
<center><H1>LUnix-Assembler (<EM>luna</EM>)</H1></center>
<CENTER><H2>version: Nov 23 1997</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Many people would like to write some code for the little C64/128 but don't have
the equipment to do so. So i decided to write a small (and therefore very portable)
assembler in a subset of ansi-C. This assembler compiles without modifications
on every (GNU-) C-compiler. </H3>
<H3>Additional this assembler is optimized to generate LUnix-applications. This is
done by including a LUnix-binary-header-generator. This is why all new LUnix-applications will be in
luna-format. Also the next version of the LUnix-kernel will be in this format (4400 lines yet! :-) </H3>
<H3>The <A HREF="src/luna.c">sourcecode</A> is around 1800 lines of C.</H3>

<P>
<H3>If you have compiled luna on an other system, especially systems that come without
a c-compiler, please email me the executable, to include it here.</H3>

<P>
<H2>How to use luna:</H2>
<H3>Luna just assembles a source (text) file into a destination (binary) file which
is executable on a C64/128. There is no editor included! The inputfile may be 
written with every text-editor that saves files in plain ascii-format.</H3>

<P>
<H3>There is also a <A HREF="doc/luna.doc">ascii-documentation file</A></H3>
 
<P>
<H3>Source-format: (look into the ascii documentation for more)</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Comments are seperated by a leading ";"
  <LI>Label definitions look like
  <UL>
    <LI>&lt;label&gt;:
    <LI>&lt;label&gt; equ &lt;expression&gt;
  </UL>
  <LI>Expressions look like
  <UL>
    <LI>&lt;value&gt;[{+,-,&lt;,&gt;,&amp;,|}&lt;value&gt;]*
    <LI>with &lt;value&gt;={[#]decimal,$hex,%bin,&lt;label&gt;,"&lt;char&gt;",*}
  </UL>
  Expressions may be preceeded by "&lt;" to select the lower byte, or "&gt;" to 
  select the higher byte of a 16bit-expression.
  <LI>Special assembler-commands
  <UL>
    <LI>.byte &lt;expression&gt;[,&lt;expression&gt;]*
    <LI>.word &lt;expression&gt;[,&lt;expression&gt;]*
    <LI>.longword &lt;expression&gt;[,&lt;expression&gt;]*
    <LI>.asc "string\n\0" 
    <LI>.head "cmd-name" [&lt;ZP-label&gt;[,&lt;ZP-label&gt;]*] - insert LUnix-header and switch to <STRONG>LUnix-mode</STRONG>
    <LI>.org &lt;expression&gt; -  sets start address
    <LI>.buf &lt;expression&gt; - insert #n (empty) bytes
    <LI>.code - enter code-area (only in <STRONG>LUnix-mode</STRONG>)
    <LI>.data - enter data-area (only in <STRONG>LUnix-mode</STRONG>)
    <LI>.endofcode - no more code (enter data-area, only in <STRONG>LUnix-mode</STRONG>)
    <LI>.newpage - align to start of (next) page
    <LI>.global - declare a label global, a list of all globals and their value will be saved after compilation.
  </UL>
  <LI>Special labels (only used in <STRONG>LUnix-mode</STRONG>)
  <UL>
    <LI>_base - Startaddress of codesegment
    <LI>_init - Must point to init-routine
    <LI>_cleanup - Can point to a cleanup-routine (called by kill)
    <LI>_sig.killedparent - Can point to a handler
    <LI>_sig.killedchild - Can point to a handler
    <LI>_sig.userbreak - Can point to a handler
  </UL>
  <LI>Shortrange labels can be defined by a leading "+" for 
    forward or "-" for backward references (leading a assembler command). So "jmp +"
    will jump to the next "+"-reference and "jmp -" to the latest "-"-reference.
    The same way "jmp ++" will jump to the second next "+"-marker and so on.
</UL>

<P>
<H2>A simple example</H2>
<H3>The classic example is the "Hello World"-program, so this is my first example
for luna also.</H3>
<H2>This is the sourcecode located in a file named "hello.a" :</H2>
<HR>
<PRE>
  ; This is a simple "hello world" program
  ; for LUnix

  .header "hello"                ; "hello" is the name that will be displayed
                                 ; by "ps" in LUnix

          strout equ $905d       ; value of the 2 used system-vectors
          bye    equ $9018
          stdout equ _base+2     ; _base is startadress of codesegment
                                 ; and will be initialized by the assembler.

  _init:  ldx  stdout            ; load standard output-stream-ID
          jsr  strout            ; call "string output"
          bit  text_hello        ; pass text-pointer to strout 

          lda  #0                ; exitcode 0 (no error)
          jmp  bye               ; end program

          .endofcode             ; end of code

  text_hello:
          .asc "Hello, world!\n\0"

<H2>Running the assembler by typing "luna hello.a hello"
will produce this output:</H2>

<H2>This is the code generated by luna (in file "hello"):</H2>
<H3>The lines marked with "*" are generated automatically by luna, they realize
the header that Lunix needs to load and run a program. </H3>
