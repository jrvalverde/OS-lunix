<h3>Aiming for a good filesystem. A RAM-Drive used as root-filesystem.
Special-Files to enable access to device drivers. Mount/unmount filesystems,
enable directories,subdirectories,links. Multi-sessions,screens (40/80 columns)
Support of RS232 (improved routines using
the CIAs serial-ports working fine up to 9600baud without a swiftlink)
maybe SLIP + a minimal IP/TCP support. But i'm some kind of uncertain, too

realized so far :
<plaintext>
$9000 - MakeFlowTab
	Creates the process flow-table for the system IRQ.
	I very similar to the old version.

	But the maximum span of time that a process can work without
	swapping to an other process is now 31 * 1/64 sec.

$9006 - SendSig.raw
	The 'raw' sendsignal routine (used only by the system itself or
	drivers)
	< (4)=#SigNr X=PID
	> cc + A=$00 means OK
	  cc + A=$FF means dismiss (signal couldn't be sent)
	      (maybe the process doesn't catch such a signal or
	      the process' own stack it full)
	  cs + A=#ErrNr means an error

$9009 * Block
	A process can block itself using this call.
	This is used mainly by system-routines eg. when a process
	tries to write into a full pipe.
	After the process is been 'unvlocked' by eg. an other process
	(or by the IRQ-routine -> wake up after sleep)
	< A/Y=WaitState

	The defined WaitStates :
	01 xx - pipe #ch=xx is full
	02 xx - pipe #ch=xx is empty
	03 00 - no #ch free
	04 00 - not enough memory
	05 00 - process table is full
	06    -
	07 xx - wait for exitcode of IPID=xx
	08 xx - semaphore #nr=xx is locked
	09    -
	0A xx - process is sleeping
	0B xx - process has reached a breakpoint (c below)

	An example:

  try:	jsr  TryToAllocateMem
	bcc  okay

	lda  04
	ldy  00
	jsr  Block
	jmp  try
  okay: ....


	Well thats a silly example because the normal
	allocation routine does all this in any case.
	(and even better! -> look eg. $9039 LMemBlk)

	You'll need this routines only if you write new driver-code
	or other kernel expansions.

$901B * SuicErrOut
	Suicide with error output in words.
	makes just this :

	pha	    /* save the error-code    /*
	jsr ErrOut  /* prints a error message /*
	pla	    /* restore the error-code /*
	jmp Suic    /* commit suicide the normal way /*

	($900C=ErrOut,$9018=Suic)

	Defined errors are :
	0    - no error
	1-31 - same as old DOS
	32   - no such process
	33   * inadmissible arguments
	34   - locked semaphore
	35   * stack overflow
	36   - can't hook into IRQ/NMI/Alert
	37   * 'BIT $Adr.' expected
	38   * page fault
	39   * access to a foreign process
	40   - can't access channel-table

	     *<- one of those errors will terminate the
		 active process.

$901E - MUnblk
	Multiple-Unblock
	Will wake up all process with a certain WaitState
	< (C262)/(C263)=WaitState

	Again this is only used by the system itself or very system near code
	(like drivers).Don't ever call it without making 'se i' before !!

$9021 - MPAlloc
	Multiple-page-allocation
	use it to allocate to allocate more than one page (in a row -> in one
	big piece)
	< X=OccCode,A=NumOfPages
	> cs means that there was not enough memory
	  cc + A=MID
	MID=memory identification
	is identical with the first page of the allocated area
	OccCode=occupation code (normal this should be the IPID)

	Example:Allocate a piece of memory without using the higher level call

 try:	lda #10	    /* lets allocate 10 pages..	 /*
	ldx $2	    /* (2) is the actual IPID	 /*
	jsr MPAlloc
	cl i	    /* the MPAlloc contains a 'se i' ! /*
	bcc okay

	jsr LMemBlk /* c the description below	 /*
	jmp try

 okay:	...

$9033 - PFree
	page-free
	to release a allocated memory area
	< A=MID

	pfree won't wakeup other processes that are locked because of
	less memory !
	Because this is agin a lowlevel routine
	a correct pfree call using only lowlevel routines would look like
	this:

	lda #MID
	jsr PFree
       (se i)	    /* PFree does this anyway  /*
	lda #4
	sta $C262
	lda #0
	sta $c263
	jsr MUnblk  /* will wakeup all processes with WaitState=$04,$00 /*
	cl i


$9036 - SPAlloc
	single-page-allocation
	< X=OccCode
	> cs means 'no free page left'
	  cc + A=MID
	description is the same as that from MPAlloc.
	But SPAlloc uses an other search-method !
	MPAlloc serches upward and SPAlloc downward.
	and SPAlloc is much much faster then MPAlloc because
	it doesn't search for a 'best fit' it takes just the
	first free page.

$9039 - LMemBlk
	Less-memory-blockation
	Set a system flag and block the actual process
	(this system flag will force some other system-routines to
	to be more thrifty with memory eg. all page-pipes,pipes that
	are buffering more that 27bytes will lock as they were full so
	that they'll shrink...)
	The system will return to the blocked process as soon as an other
	some other process caused a PFree.

$903F * Lock
	Used to lock a semaphore or pass a semaphore (which menas the same)
	< X=#nr , cs-means forced
	> (A=#nr) cs-no success

	forced means that this routine will block the actual process to wait
	till the semaphore is unlocked.
	in unforced mode lock will return with cs in this case.

	defined semaphores:
	0     - access to the IEC-bus (used during floppy/printer actions)
	1     - keyboard
	2     - Joystick 1
	3     - Joystick 2
	...
	8 -15 - Sprites 0-7
	16-23 - Portbits ($DD01) 0-7
	24    - Alarm (realtime clock of CIA A)
	25    - IRQ job 1
	26    - IRQ job 2
	27    - IRQ job 3
	28    - NMI ($DD0C)
	...

$9042 * Unlock
	Used to unlock a semaphore.
	< X=#nr

	Unlock will do some other things too.
	Like switching sprites off/SID voices off/remove IRQ,Alert,NMI jobs
	depending on which semaphore you unlock.

$904B * SendSig
	Send a signal to an other process (or to yourself if you want to)
	< A/Y=PID,X=#SigNr
	> A=00,cc - Ok
	  A=FF,cc - can't sent
	  cs	  - error

	Does an software-emulated interrupt of the specified process
	to the adress stored at (baseadr.+8+3*#SigNr) this is a
	3 byte pointer (baseadr. is the start-page of the signal reveiving
	process)

	first byte:
	00 - the process doesn't catch this signal
	2C - the following 2 bytes contain a relative adr.
	     (relative to the baseadr. of the process)
	4C - absolute adr.

$9051 * AdaptPtr
	Used to adapt all absolute-adresses in a process' code
	This should be the first thing,that a process does.
	< A=orginal start adress (hi-byte)

	AdatpPtr will also turn the process' ability to catch signals ON.
	(before AdaptPtr all absolute signal pointer are unadapted and a
	signal would cause the processor jump into an abyss.

$9054 * Sleep
	Makes the actual process 'sleep' for a certain nubmer or
	IRQs (1/64 sec.) (well sleep at least that time,but maybe longer)
	< X/Y=duration (in 1/64 seconds)

$9057 * IRQHook
	Hook into the systems IRQ.
	There may be up to 3 jobs that are called every 1/64s.

	eg. let the border flicker for about 1 minute:

	bit irqadr   /* thats the way the system gets the IRQ job's adress
			this way you don't have to adapt the irqadr yourself,
			AdaptAdr does it for you/*
	jsr IRQHook  /* hooks into the system and locks
			the semaphore #25,#26 or #27
			to allocate either IRQ job 1,2 or 3 /*
	ldx #0
	ldy #15
	jsr Sleep    /* sleep for at least 3840/64=60 seconds /*
	ldx #25
	jsr Unlock
	ldx #26
	jsr Unlock
	ldx #27
	jsr Unlock   /* have to (try to) unlock all these semaphores because
			you can't be sure which job the system choosed. /*
	...
 irqadr:inc $D020
	rts

$905A * AlertHook
	Works the same way as IRQHook but gives access to
	the CIA A's alert interrupt (bit 2 of $DC0D)

$905D * NMIHook
	Again the same like the obove.
	But this  time you have to return with

	pla
	tay
	pla
	tax
	pla
	rti

	..from your NMI job.

$9060 * GetIPID
	Gets the IPID from a PID.
	(internal process ID ranges from 0 to 31 and is the pointer into the
	process-info tables,the PID ranges from 1..65535!)
	Don't handle with IPIDs without disabled IRQs,because the IPID may
	change after process swapping.
	< A/Y=PID
	> X=IPID,  cs-error(no such process)

$9078 - DAlloc
	descriptor allocation
	Allocatres a 32byte field to store
	eg. pipe-desciptors/contents
	    file-desciptors
	    information about #channels opened by a process
	    ...
	< -
	> X=#ch,(4)/(5)=pointer to the allocated 32byte-field

	There is a #ch - number abjoined to every allocated byte-field.

$907B - DFree
	set a allocated descriptor free.
	< X=#ch


      * <-- marks a 'high level' routine.
	such routines will return with 'cl i'
	and don't require a disabled IRQ.

Most of the 'high level'-calls and some of the 'low level's may return with
B
cs (-error) and A=#ErrCode.
I thought about a way reduce the work to catch all these errors.

You can catch a error by a following

	    bcs catcherror
	    ...

 catcherror:...

or now easier by

	    nop

Everytime there is an error (and that should be a rare situation :)
the system look if the call is followed by a 'nop'
or not,if so the system will jump to $901B SuicErrOut in case of an error.
I think that a good idea,to reduce work for programmers.

An other feature i've implemented jet is the ability to use 'brk' to set
breakpoints in your process-code,this will make it easier to search for
bugs.

Usage:
       brk
       @1 #Code

       the raw brk followed by a #code of your choice (to sparate the
       breakpoints if you've set more that one)

       if the process reaches this brk the actual process will be blocked with
       WaitState=$0B/#Code

to continue the process just do this:

       se i
       lda #$0B
       sta $C262
       lda #Code
       sta $C263
       jsr MUnblk
       cl i

       (...in an other process of cause)


I've also improoved the time measure routine
it now counts the processor-clock-ticks !
in a 5byte counter (max 12d 22h 4m 15.43sec.) .
I've used the second timer of CIA A, so the measured time
will be right even when the process has retarded the IRQ.
(ok only if the retardion is less than 65milliseconds.)
