NOTE:
=====

to compile LNG with lupo 0.16 you have to add a very small patch:
 change line 180 from
    a=='ß' || a=='.' ) return 0;
 to
    a=='ß' ) return 0;

PATCH:
======
to apply the patch LNG0.01 -> LNG0.02
change to the directory where you untarred the LNG tree and type

  patch <patch0.01-0.02

you can also try to apply the patch by hand (the patchfiele is human readable)
